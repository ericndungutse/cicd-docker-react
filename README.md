## Journey to Automated Deployments for React Apps on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

This repository shares my experience in implementing CI/CD workflows for React applications hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Dive deep into:

- **Dockerizing a React app**: Streamline builds and deployments with containerized environments.
- **CI automation with Travis CI**: Trigger builds and tests automatically every code change.
- **Secure OCI registry**: Deploy container images to a secure and reliable OCI registry.
- **CI/CD pipeline on OCI**: Automate the entire deployment process from code commit to production.

**Target audience:**

- React developers targeting OCI deployments.
- Devops engineers seeking CI/CD expertise on OCI.
- Anyone aiming for automated and secure deployments on this platform.

**Join the journey!**:

- Fork this repository and follow along step-by-step.
- Share your learnings and questions in the Discussions tab.
- Contribute your own OCI-specific CI/CD configurations.

Let's master CI/CD and unlock the power of automated deployments on OCI for your React app!
